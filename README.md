These are JavaScript buffer definitions for the s2client-api by Blizzard. The Protocol Buffers (protobuf) library by Google was installed and built from https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases. Then the s2client-proto definitions library by Blizzard was installed from https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto. Finally, the JavaScript definitions were generated by using the protoc command.

TODO: Explain how to use these.

TODO: Make this into an npm package that works out of the box.

# How to replicate this project
## protobuf
Extract .tar.gz file:
```
tar -xzf protobuf-cpp-x.x.x.tar.gz
```
cd into the extracted directory:
```
cd protobuf-x.x.x
```
Build the code:
```
./configure
make
make check
sudo make install
```
Verify that the installation was successful:
```
protoc --version
```
You may need to load it up!
```
sudo ldconfig
protoc --version
```

## s2client-proto
Get the project:
```
git clone https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto.git
```

## Generate JavaScript
cd to the protocol directory:
```
cd /PATH/TO/s2client-api/protocol/s2clientprotocol
```
Generate the JavaScript:
```
protoc --proto_path=.. --js_out=/PATH/TO/s2proto-js/js s2clientprotocol/sc2api.proto
```
